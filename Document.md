# IoT-Based Smart Waste Management and Sorting System

**Submitted by:** Sanjai B

**Roll No:** EC23B1081

**College:** IIITDM Kancheepuram

## 1. Problems Solved by the Proposed Solution

- **Lack of real-time waste tracking**  
  Our system enables live monitoring of the amount and type of waste generated in different areas of the campus. This removes the need for manual checking and reduces inefficiencies in collection.

- **Inefficient waste sorting**  
  With onboard AI, we automate sorting right at the bin. This prevents recyclables from getting mixed with general waste and improves recycling outcomes and sorting means sort ny organic , metal and plastic.

- **Manual and non-optimal collection**  
  Instead of following daily or fixed-time collection routines, bins send alerts only when they are nearly full. This saves manpower and reduces fuel usage.

- **Low user awareness and tracking**  
  QR codes on bins allow users to scan and receive reward points for disposing of waste correctly. This encourages proper usage and better participation.

- **Lack of data-driven waste management**  
  All bin data is sent to a cloud dashboard where we can access full analytics—for example, which zones produce more plastic or organic waste. This supports smarter planning and resource allocation.

## 2. Flowchart of System Workflow

1. User throws waste in the smart bin.

2. Sensor module inside the bin detects the current fill-level and captures an image of the newly added waste.

3. An onboard AI module processes the image to classify the waste—as plastic, paper, or organic.

4. A microcontroller (like an ESP32) processes and records this data, updating internal memory with both fill level and type identified.

5. The microcontroller uses a wireless module (via WiFi or LoRa) to send this data in real-time to the campus cloud server.

6. The cloud dashboard receives and analyzes the incoming bin data, allowing campus staff to see statistics like fill percentage, waste composition, and trends.

7. If the fill level crosses a predefined threshold (e.g., 85% full), the system automatically generates a collection alert, notifying cleaning staff to empty that bin.

## 3. Explanation of Technology Used

### Hardware

- **Smart Bin Sensors**  
  Each bin includes an ultrasonic fill sensor, weight sensor, small camera, and gas sensor (to detect organic waste).

- **Sorting Mechanism**  
  A compact internal system with servo motors and a rotating base helps direct different types of waste to the correct compartment.

- **Microcontroller**  
  An ESP32 controls sensors and sorting hardware, collects data, and handles connectivity.

- **Connectivity**  
  WiFi or LoRa modules transmit data to a central server depending on availability and range.

### Software

- **Edge AI Model**  
  A TensorFlow Lite-based image classification model runs on the device to identify waste types (e.g., plastic bottle , paper , banana peel , metal).

- **Cloud Backend**  
  MQTT protocol or Node-RED tools collect and manage data from bins across the campus.Use Node-RED if you need a no-code dashboard and logic handling.

- **Dashboard**  
  A web dashboard (built with React or Angular) displays live bin data, including location, fill percentage, waste composition, and overall analytics.

- **User Interface**  
  QR codes placed on the bins allow users to interact via mobile for feedback, rewards, or reporting issues.

## 4. Comparison with Existing Systems

| **Aspect**         | **Current System**            | **Proposed Model**                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection    | Manual checking               | Automatic via sensors and connectivity    |
| Waste Sorting      | Hand-sorted by custodial staff| AI-based automatic sorting at the source  |
| Collection Timing  | Fixed/daily schedule          | Dynamic, alert-based scheduling           |
| Data & Analytics   | Minimal or manual             | Cloud-based live dashboard and insights   |
| Scalability        | Depends on manpower           | Easily expandable with modular IoT bins   |

## 5. Potential Challenges

- **Upfront Cost & Infrastructure**  
  Initial investment is required for smart bin hardware, sensors, and server setup.

- **AI Classification Accuracy**  
  Real-world conditions like poor lighting, waste dirt, or obstructions may affect model accuracy and require regular retraining.

- **Maintenance Requirements**  
  Bins may need cleaning and sensor calibration to remain accurate and reliable in use.

- **Network Connectivity**  
  Some outdoor areas may face WiFi issues. This can be solved with mesh networking or LoRaWAN modules.

- **Privacy**  
  Camera modules must be positioned to avoid capturing personal data, and proper data protection policies must be followed.
